## Projects

### Game Development Projects

#### Unity 3D

  - [Rocky The Rocket](https://github.com/alieantar/RockyTheRocket/releases/tag/release)
  
    Developed and released the first version of a game using Unity3D and C# where the player navigates a rocket through an environment while considering gravity, drag, and falling objects to land on a landing pad. The     game is in continual progress as more features and capabilities are added.
  
  - [Obstacle Course VR](https://youtu.be/jcTUmnbQvEk)

    Developed a three-dimensional virtual reality game using Unity3D and C# where the player navigates a course without colliding with objects in the environment. The purpose of this project was to showcase shader graph capabilities to model naturally-occuring phenomenon such as iridescence, glow effects, refraction, etc.
 
  - [Jedi Trainer VR Demo](https://youtu.be/n6IBGKmVrFA)

    Collaborated with a teammate to develop a game where the player faces attack droids in a sci-fi themed environment, and has to redirect their attacks using their light saber.
 
  - [3D Fruit Ninja VR Demo](https://youtu.be/bPoDIvtrQOk)

    Collaborated with a teammate to develop a 3D game where the player uses a sword to fight off fruits in a tropical environment.

### Data Science / Machine Learning Projects

<b>Python</b>

  - [Heart Disease Classifier](https://github.com/alieantar/HeartDiseaseClassifier)

    Developed a binary classifier using machine learning to predict whether a patient may have heart disease based on learned features from a dataset.
  
  - [Classifying Tumors from a Dataset of Microscopic Breast Biopsy Images ](https://github.com/alieantar/BreastCancerClassification)
    
    Utilized a convolutional neural network to extract features and classify tumors as benign or malignant from a dataset of microscopic breast biopsy images.
    
  - [Image Edge Detection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cS3kjNdI2ZZb4urzlZAh4Ea2vXhddMk2?usp=drive_link)

    Developed a program that reads a gray-scale image, stores it as a matrix, applies convolution, non-maximum thresholding, and hysteresis thresholding to obtain a final edge map of the image.

  - [Image Segmentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WpbxOqUUVHW7RAJ_Y6KUonRSMfbtx_tN?usp=drive_link)

    Created a program that reads an image and performs binarization at three different threshold levels, as well as applies Otsu thresholding to perform image segmentation.
